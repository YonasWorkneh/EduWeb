        <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
        <p>
          Students should meet with their academic mentor/advisor to determine their course choices for study away in New York. You are expected to take a full course-load (4 courses or 16-18 credits). In order to register, you will be assigned a registration time to select your courses through NYU Albert. As NYU students register in order of seniority, your first choice of courses may already be filled by the time your registration window opens. To be prepared, select three back-up course choices in case you are unable to register for your most desired courses. Students who would like to take courses in restricted programs at Tisch, Steinhardt, and Stern should work with their mentors/advisors well in advance of registration.<br><br>Your classes may be spread across NYU’s Greenwich Village and Brooklyn campuses. Keep in mind you may need over 15 minutes to reach a class housed in a different building. Your class schedule will contain building codes for the locations of your class. Please reference the registrar’s website for the building code key to determine where your classes will take place.<br><br>The Elmer Holmes Bobst Library is NYU New York's main library. It is a 12-story building that holds more than one million electronic books, journals, and databases; 235,000 print serial subscriptions, 500,000 government documents, and more than 41,000 linear feet of archives and manuscripts. In New York, NYU also has specialized subject libraries.The Academic Resource Center (ARC) is the place to go with academic navigation questions. With two locations, it offers a variety of academic support resources, including peer tutoring through the University Learning Center, as well as referrals to other academic resources. Additional resources at the ARC include an Argo Tea Café, computers and ITS printer, and a variety of study spaces.<br><br>NYU encourages students to participate fully in all aspects of campus life. In support of this goal, the Moses Center for Student Accessibility provides reasonable and appropriate accommodations for students with documented disabilities. Students qualify as persons with disabilities if their diagnosed physical, learning, or psychological impairments limit them in one or more life activities. Reasonable accommodations are adjustments to policies, practices, or procedures that facilitate equal access for students with disabilities to NYU’s programs, activities, and services.<br><br>Your classes may be spread across NYU’s Greenwich Village and Brooklyn campuses.
